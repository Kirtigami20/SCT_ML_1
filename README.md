# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on a few key features:  
- Living area in square feet (`GrLivArea`)  
- Number of bedrooms above ground (`BedroomAbvGr`)  
- Number of full bathrooms (`FullBath`)  

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
````

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Place the `train.csv` file in the project directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python house_price_model.py
```

## 📌 Code Workflow

### **1. Import Libraries**

* `pandas` → Data handling
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization
* `sklearn` → Model building & evaluation

### **2. Load and Prepare Data**

* Reads `train.csv`.
* Selects relevant features: `GrLivArea`, `BedroomAbvGr`, `FullBath`.
* Drops rows with missing values.

### **3. Train/Test Split**

* Splits dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### **4. Train Model**

* Uses **Linear Regression** to fit the training data.
* Outputs model intercept & coefficients.

### **5. Evaluate Model**

* Predicts house prices on test data.
* Evaluates using:

  * **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
  * **R² Score**

### **6. Visualization**

* Plots **Actual vs Predicted Prices**.

### **7. Example Prediction**

* Predicts price for a new house (e.g., `2000 sqft, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms`).

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Intercept: 20000.45
GrLivArea: 115.60
BedroomAbvGr: -8000.32
FullBath: 9500.12

Model Performance:
Mean Squared Error: 2.1e+09
R-squared: 0.71

Predicted Price for new house: 245678.90
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add more features (LotArea, Neighborhood, YearBuilt, etc.)
* Try advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, RandomForest, XGBoost).
* Use feature engineering and log transformations for better accuracy.
* Build a Kaggle `submission.csv` for leaderboard scoring.

Would you like me to also prepare the **`house_price_model.py` file** so you can just drop it into your repo along with this README?
